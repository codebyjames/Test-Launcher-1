# Test-Launcher-1


This project is for anyone needing working examples of Package Manager, Widget, and Launcher! I did not add the ability to host widgets inside of the launcher itself.

In this app you can do the following:

1) create a list of installed apps: system + other
2) update widget
3) open device settings
4) pick a launcher
5) change wallpaper
6) launch app from installed apps list

** side note - you can use a ViewPager to host fragments for your launcher screens

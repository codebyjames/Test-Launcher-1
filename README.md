# Test-Launcher-1


This project is for anyone learning to use Package Manager, Broadcast Receiver, Widgets, and Launchers!

In this app you can do the following:

1) create a list of installed apps: system + other
2) update widget
3) open device settings
4) pick a launcher
5) change wallpaper
6) launch app from installed apps list

I may post a part two using a WidgetHost to arrange widgets inside of the app, but that might be something you should research on your own, so you get experience & satisfaction of figuring out how to implement such features. 

** side note - you can use a ViewPager to host fragments for your launcher screens
